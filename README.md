# A boilerplate web application in Spring framework 4 and Backbone #

This application provides a folder structure, an overview of how the
folder structure should look in a big application.

The bussines logic is built around decoratee pattern which I consider
a good practice in big projects.

MongoDB - for storaged

Backbone - backbone framework for building the frontend

Maven
